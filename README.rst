Requirements
------------

In addition to Python >=3.6, and the modules ``pip`` gets for you during Install_:

- ``rawr`` needs ``aria2c`` in the ``PATH`` if you want it to start a download for you.

- Before beginning a download, ``rawr`` will show some info about your connection,
  using the first method whose required command(s) are detected, checking in this order:

  - ``mullvad``
  - ``nmcli`` and ``grep``
  - ``https`` (httpie__)
  - ``curl``
  - ``wget``

- If ``xclip`` or ``pbcopy`` are found,
  the chosen magnet URI will be copied to the clipboard.

- If ``df`` is found, you will get a notice about your hardware's free space
  when showing search results.
